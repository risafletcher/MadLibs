This is a small, basic HTML, CSS, Javascript project for beginners. 

## What is HTML, CSS, and Javascript?
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. 
With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

## HTML
Here's a small snippet of an HTML website. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**DOCTYPE** specifies which version of HTML we are using. As of current, we are using HTML5. `!DOCTYPE` should be used at the top
of every HTML document.

`<html>` is a tag that wraps our HTML document. 

Let's get into our main HTML elements:
* [`<head>`](./docs/head.md)
* [`<body>`](./docs/body.md)

## CSS

CSS is a style sheet language. We use CSS to tell the browser how to style our website. We target elements
on the page that we want to style, then describe style rules for those elements.

Let's learn more about CSS:
* [**CSS**](./docs/css.md)

## Javascript

Javascript is a "high-level" programming language. By "high-level" we mean that it's 
easier to read & write (it actually looks like English) instead of a lower-level language, which is considered
machine code.

We use Javascript to bring life to websites and applications. You can use HTML and CSS to make a sweet
looking button, but without Javascript, the button wouldn't do anything!

Javascript is an ever-changing language. Previously, we were only able to use it for websites, but now we're
able to use it on the server side (we can use it to control how data is moved about, among other things),
and non-web applications such as desktop applications and mobile apps!

There's a lot fo learn here so let's get to the basics:
