# `<body>`
The `<body>` tag defines the document's body. This is where the magic happens!
The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

There are many elements that can go inside our `<body>` element, but here are some common ones:

* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
  + These are header tags. `<h1>` Is the largest, while `<h2>`, `<h3>` and so forth incrementally get smaller.

* `<div>`
  + This tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It's a container that holds other elements.
  Think of it as a box that holds all of the good stuff.
  
* `<p>`
  + The <p> tag defines a paragraph.
  + Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each <p> element. The margins can be modified with CSS 
  (with the margin properties).
  + This is where you'll enter your text.
  
* `<ol>`, `<ul>`
  + These tags will create a list. You will use them to wrap `<li>` elements.
  + `<ol>` stands for **ordered list**. It will create a numbered list.
  + `<ul>` stands for **unordered list**. It will create a bulleted list.
 
  + `<li>` stands for **list item**. You will use these to wrap your list item content, creating a list
  element.
  
* `<button>`
  + As the name suggests, this creates a button. You can attach events to it so that it does stuff when
  you click on it!
