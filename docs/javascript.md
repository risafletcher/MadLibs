# Javascript

As previously discussed, Javascript is a programming language that allows us to give life to our websites
and applications. Say we create a button:
```
<button>Submit</button>
```
Great! However, our button won't do anything. You can click it all you like, but nothing happens. Why?
Because we haven't told our program what to do when the button is clicked!

Contrary to popular belief, computers aren't very "smart". They don't know how to do what you want them
to do without directions. This is what programmers do! We write instructions for computers. 

Computers are *kind* of like humans. They follow directions and sometimes forget things and get lost. 

Let's go over some basic data types before we get started.

A `var` or `let` is a **variable**. Just like math, a variable is a value. We give it a name so we can
use it later on. You can think of it as an ingredient. 

A `function` is an **action**, or a verb. It performs an action and gives life to our application.

In this project, we're storing our `<input/>` elements in a variable so that
we can use them in our story.

Our`<button>` element will *call* a **function** which will *create* or
*generate* our story. 

Inside our `libIt()` function, we will define our input variables
and `return` our story using those variables.
